MM-TiMidity-MCD
===============

TiMidity plays MIDI and Module (.MOD) files. It does it in software without depending on any hardware MIDI support your soundcard might have. Sound quaility can be much higher because it limited by your CPU's power and memory rather then your soundcard's power and memory.
