       timidity.cfg - configure file of TiMidity++



</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <B>/etc/timidity.cfg</B>

       <B>/usr/local/share/timidity/timidity.cfg</B>




</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The  file  <I>timidity.cfg</I> describes the runtime environments
       of <B>timidity(1)</B> that are the path of  sound  font,  instru-
       ments configrations or else.
       <I>TiMidity</I>  looks for the configuration file <I>timidity.cfg</I> at
       startup, before processing any options.  If  it  can't  be
       accessed, and the library path is changed with a -L option
       on the command line, then the default file will be  sought
       again  along  the  new  library  path after processing all
       options, unless another configuration file  was  specified
       with the -c option.

       Configuration files define the mapping of MIDI programs to
       instrument files. Multiple files may  be   specified,  and
       statements in later ones will override earlier ones.





</PRE>
<H2>FORMAT</H2><PRE>
       Following statements can be used in a configuration file:


       <B>dir</B> <I>directory</I>
              Adds  <I>directory</I> to the search path in the same man-
              ner as the <B>-L</B> command line  option.   Archive  file
              are also allowed. For example:















              1 baz.pat
              2 zoo.pat
              0 bar.pat

              At  first, <B>dir</B> specities the archive name (followed
              by '#') for the path of patch files same as  direc-
              tory  name (in this case , "/usr/local/share/timid-
              ity/inst/foo.zip").  TiMidity recognize the path is
              an  archive  file  if  the  expression has the last
              character '#', and also read the files contained in
              this  archive file.  In previouns example the patch
              files bar.pat, baz.pat and zoo.pat contained in the
              foo.zip are also installed.


       <B>source</B> <I>file</I>
              Reads  another  configuration  file, then continues
              processing the current one.


       <B>bank</B> <I>number</I>
              Selects the tone bank to  modify.   Patch  mappings
              that follow will affect this tone bank.


       <B>progbase</B> <I>number</I>
              Sets  and  displays  the tone number from <I>number</I> to
              <I>number+128</I>.  If  <B>progbase</B>  <B>1</B>  are  specified,  tone
              numbers that follow are setted and displayed as the
              numbers from 1 to 128.


       <B>drumset</B> <I>number</I>
              Selects  the  drum  set  to modify.  Patch mappings
              that follow will affect this drum set.


       <B>number</B> <I>file</I> <I>[options]</I>
              Specifies  that  the the MIDI program number in the
              current tone bank or  drum  set  should  be  played
              using  the  patch  file.  options may be any of the
              following:


              <B>amp=</B><I>amplification</I>
                     Amplifies the instrument's volume by  <I>ampli-</I>
                     <I>fication</I>  percent. If no value is specified,
                     one will be automatically  determined  when-
                     ever the instrument is loaded.


              <B>note=</B><I>note</I>
                     instrument will be played at  whatever  note
                     the  Note  On  event  triggering it has. For
                     percussion instruments, if no value is spec-
                     ified in the configuration file, the default
                     in the patch file will be used.


              <B>pan=</B><I>panning</I>
                     Sets  the instrument's default panning. pan-
                     ning may be <B>left</B>, <B>right</B>, <B>center</B>, or an  nte-
                     ger  between  -100   and   100,  designating
                     full  left  and full right respectively.  If
                     no value is specified, the  default  in  the
                     patch  file will be used.  Note that panning
                     controls in MIDI files  will  override  this
                     value.


              <B>keep=</B>{<B>loop</B>|<B>env</B>}
                     By  default,  percussion  instruments   have
                     their    loop   and   envelope   information
                     stripped.  Strangely  shaped  envelopes  are
                     removed  automatically  from melodic instru-
                     ments as  well. <B>keep</B> can be used to  prevent
                     stripping envelope or loop data.  For  exam-
                     ple, the Short and Long  Whistle  percussion
                     instruments (General Midi numbers 71 and 72)
                     need to have `<B>keep=loop</B> <B>keep=env</B>'  specified
                     in the configuration file.


              <B>strip=</B>{<B>loop</B>|<B>env</B>|<B>tail</B>}
                     Force  removal  of loop or envelope informa-
                     tion from all patches in the instrument,  or
                     strip  the  tail,  i.e.  all  data after the
                     loop.   Some  third-party  instruments  have
                     garbage  after  the loop, as evidenced by  a
                     clicking noise whenever  the  instrument  is
                     played, so adding the strip=tail option will
                     markedly improve sound quality.

       The following statements are available only latest  TiMid-
       ity.


       <B>#extension</B> <B>altassign</B> <I>program1</I> <I>program2</I> <I>...</I>
              Sets  the alternate assign for drum set.  For exam-
              ple, if you want to pronounce Hi-Hat cymbals  (note
              number  42/44/46)  in  the drumset 0 exclusively to
              each others, specify:

              drumset 0
              default.


       <B>#extension</B> <B>comm</B> <I>program</I> <I>secound</I>
              Specifies  the  comment <I>comment</I> for the tone number
              <I>program</I>.  These comments are displayed in the indi-
              cater  line  at  the  case  TiMidity is booted with
              option <B>-int</B>, <B>-iTt</B>.


       <B>#extension</B> <B>timeout</B> <I>program</I> <I>secound</I>
              Specifies the time-out value of the <I>program</I>. If any
              notes  pronounced  with the tone number <I>program</I> are
              suspended more than <I>second</I> seconds, TiMidity  kills
              the notes.


       <B>#extension</B> <B>copydrumset</B> <I>drumset</I>
              Copies  all  settings of the <I>drumset</I> to the current
              drumset.


       <B>#extension</B> <B>copybank</B> <I>bank</I>
              Copies all settings of  the  <I>bank</I>  to  the  current
              bank.


       <B>#extension</B> <B>HTTPproxy</B> <I>hostname:port</I>
              Specifies  the proxy of the HTTP protocol. <I>hostname</I>
              and <I>port</I> <B>are</B> <B>of</B> <B>the</B> <B>proxy</B> <B>host's.</B>


       <B>#extension</B> <B>FTPproxy</B> <I>hostname:port</I>
              Specifies the prox of the  FTP  protocol.  Same  as
              HTTP.


       <B>#extension</B> <B>mailaddr</B> <I>your-mail-address</I>
              Specifies  user's  mail  address.  This  address is
              sended to the FTP server  if  TiMidity  access  any
              file via FTp.


       <B>#extension</B> <B>opt</B> <B>[-]{option}</B> <I>[optarg]</I>
              Sets the value of boot-time options.


       <B>#extension</B> <B>undef</B> <I>progno</I>
              Undefine the tone <I>progno</I> of current tone bank.

       These "#extension" statements are beginning with character
       '#' that is the comment flag of old TiMidity(version  0.2i
       The latest TiMidity treats "#extension" as white-space. So
       you can omit it.


       If  any  <I>file-name</I>  expression  ended  with  character '|'
       (Ascii 0x7c), the file-name is treated as command and out-
       puts  of  the  command  are  also examined as arguments of
       statements.
